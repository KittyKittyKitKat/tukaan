Tukaan is the new, pythonic and colorful (like a keel-billed toucan) framework that aims to replace Tkinter.
It has everything (on my computer, not at GitHub) that you need to develop cross-platform GUIs.


## WIP
Although all the basic widgets and other objects already exist on my local repo, they are not yet ready to push them to GitHub.
I only push things to GotHub that work and can be tried, but they are still in progress, so you shouldnâ€™t use it in any project. 


## Credits
Many thing in Tukaan is based on:

- [Akuli's Teek](https://github.com/Akuli/teek) (TODO: which, and why?)
- [Ckyiu's TkZero](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TkZero)
- one of my private Gists
